A Collation of Research and Prompts for Context Engineering

---

## Overview

This repository is a curated library of resources, research papers, and practical prompts focused on context engineering for agents and large language models (LLMs). It brings together the latest developments, best practices, and implementation examples from the AI and agent research community.


## Project Structure

- **base-prompts/**: Curated prompt templates and best practices for agent and LLM workflows (e.g., `javascript-typescript-best-practices.md`).
- **meta-prompts/**: Higher-level context engineering strategies and meta-guides (e.g., `context-engineering.md`).
- **research/**: Research papers, surveys, and curated links related to agent prompting and context engineering (e.g., `agent-prompting-links.md`).
